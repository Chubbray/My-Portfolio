                    <p>
                    I have been a member of the Utah Army National Guard sense the 28th of August 2000. For most of my time in the military I have been in a leadership position more importantly I have worked as part of a team to complete our missions. Also with my time in the military we have started to become more technologically advanced. I have been fortunate enough to have gone to the training on the different systems that the military uses. This is when I became interested in computer programing and started taking classes for it. I am currently working a Python programing class through Udemy. I have experience using Visual Studio 2017 and intelliJ platforms for writing code.
